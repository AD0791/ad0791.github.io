# Welcome to my website!

I am a disciplined, detail-oriented person with good communication skills and appropriate training and work experience. My goal is to be highly efficient and deliver products that meet customer needs and requests.

I have 7 years of experience in R * Python as a data analyst (dashboard, visualization, data manipulation and geoanalysis). I've worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL and Mongo databases. I've implemented REST services to serve a dashboard with the fastapi framework. In addition, I have experience with express and flask. I have some experience with web sockets and graphql. In addition, I have strong Wordpress development skills.

Below is a detailed list of my skills.

- Quarto and Rmarkdown (an open-source scientific and technical publishing system)
- Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Polars & Pandas, Seaborn & GGplot
- Geopandas, folium and leaflet
- Shiny and streamlit
- WordPress (website design and development)
- SQL (programming, administration)
- JS (nodejs)
- HTML5, CSS, CSS3
- backend development (fastapi, express, flask,Restapi, graphql, web socket)

I'd like to make it clear that for me, development is much more than a way to earn money. It's also my passion. So I'll do my best in every detail of every order, because the customer's ultimate satisfaction is my priority.

Please don't hesitate to contact me and I'll be delighted to work with you.

Thank you in advance for choosing me.

Yours sincerely

Alexandro Disla

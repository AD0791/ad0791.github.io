My goal is to be highly efficient and deliver products that meet customer needs and requests.\n\nI have 7 years of experience in R * Python as a data analyst (dashboard, visualization, data manipulation and geoanalysis). I've worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL and Mongo databases. I've implemented REST services to serve a dashboard with the fastapi framework. In addition, I have experience with express and flask. I have some experience with web sockets and graphql. In addition, I have strong Wordpress development skills.\n\nBelow is a detailed list of my skills.\n\n- Quarto and Rmarkdown (an open-source scientific and technical publishing system)\n- Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Polars & Pandas, Seaborn & GGplot\n- Geopandas, folium and leaflet\n- Shiny and streamlit\n- WordPress (website design and development)\n- SQL (programming, administration)\n- JS (nodejs)\n- HTML5, CSS, CSS3\n- backend development (fastapi, express, flask,Restapi, graphql, web socket)\n\nI'd like to make it clear that for me, development is much more than a way to earn money. It's also my passion. So I'll do my best in every detail of every order, because the customer's ultimate satisfaction is my priority.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me and I'll be delighted to work with you.\n\nThank you in advance for choosing me.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nAlexandro Disla\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to [contact me](mailto:alexandrodisla@hotmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\n\n",

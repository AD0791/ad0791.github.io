My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

My goal is to be highly efficient and deliver products that meet customer needs and requests.\nI have Graduated from a school of applied economics and statistics. I have multiples of experiences in the fields of data analysis, modeling and backend engineering. In my daily job, I do exploratory data analysis to ensure the data quality of the multiple sources of data within the organization.I submit the bad data to be corrected by the data entry team or the IT team. I build automation reports that met the specified requirements. These reports are a combination of sql (or mongo queries), sqlalchemy, pymongo, pandas (or polars) and tidyverse (if needed). The goal is to present the results in the required format (word, excell, powerpoint, visualization) or the required context (a python/R dashboard, a web services).

It is much more than a way to earn money. It’s also my passion.

    "text": "Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet. Even copying and pasting the lyrics of your favorite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves automation. Some websites don’t like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don’t mind.\nIf you’re scraping a page respectfully for educational purposes, then you’re unlikely to have any problems. Still, it’s a good idea to do some research on your own and make sure that you’re not violating any Terms of Service before you start a large-scale project.\n\n\nSay you’re a surfer, both online and in real life, and you’re looking for employment. However, you’re not looking for just any job. With a surfer’s mindset, you’re waiting for the perfect opportunity to roll your way!\nThere’s a job site that offers precisely the kinds of jobs you want. Unfortunately, a new position only pops up once in a blue moon, and the site doesn’t provide an email notification service. You think about checking up on it every day, but that doesn’t sound like the most fun and productive way to spend your time.\nThankfully, the world offers other ways to apply that surfer’s mindset! Instead of looking at the job site every day, you can use Python to help automate your job search’s repetitive parts. Automated web scraping can be a solution to speed up the data collection process. You write your code once, and it will get the information you want many times and from many pages.\nIn contrast, when you try to get the information you want manually, you might spend a lot of time clicking, scrolling, and searching, especially if you need large amounts of data from websites that are regularly updated with new content. Manual web scraping can take a lot of time and repetition.\nThere’s so much information on the Web, and new information is constantly added. You’ll probably be interested in at least some of that data, and much of it is just out there for the taking. Whether you’re actually on the job hunt or you want to download all the lyrics of your favorite artist, automated web scraping can help you accomplish your goals.\n\n\n\n7 Best Python Libraries For Web Scraping\n\n\nBeautifulSoup Features of BeautifulSoup Pros of BeautifulSoup Cons of BeautifulSoup Scrapy Features of Scrapy Pros of Scrapy Cons of Scrapy Selenium Features of Selenium Pros of Selenium Cons of Selenium Requests Features of Requests Pros of Requests Cons of Requests Urllib3 Features of urllib3 Pros of urllib3 Cons of urllib3 Lxml Features of LXML Pros of LXML Cons of LXML MechanicalSoup Features of MechanicalSoup Pros of MechanicalSoup Cons of MechanicalSoup\n\n\n\nSome website providers offer application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow you to access their data in a predefined manner. With APIs, you can avoid parsing HTML. Instead, you can access the data directly using formats like JSON and XML. HTML is primarily a way to present content to users visually.\nWhen you use an API, the process is generally more stable than gathering the data through web scraping. That’s because developers create APIs to be consumed by programs rather than by human eyes.\nThe front-end presentation of a site might change often, but such a change in the website’s design doesn’t affect its API structure. The structure of an API is usually more permanent, which means it’s a more reliable source of the site’s data.\nHowever, APIs can change as well. The challenges of both variety and durability apply to APIs just as they do to websites. Additionally, it’s much harder to inspect the structure of an API by yourself if the provided documentation lacks quality.\nThe approach and tools you need to gather information using APIs are outside the scope of this tutorial. To learn more about it, check out API Integration in Python.\n\nNow let’s run a project with Beautiful Soup and scrapy"
